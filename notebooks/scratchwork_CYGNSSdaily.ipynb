The CYGNSS observatories fly &#x27;, &#x27;in 510 km circular orbits at a common inclination of 35°. Each &#x27;, &#x27;observatory includes a Delay Doppler Mapping Instrument (DDMI) &#x27;, &#x27;consisting of a modified GPS receiver capable of measuring surface &#x27;, &#x27;scattering, a low gain zenith antenna for measurement of the direct &#x27;, &#x27;GPS signal, and two high gain nadir antennas for measurement of the &#x27;, &#x27;weaker scattered signal. Each DDMI is capable of measuring 4 &#x27;, &#x27;simultaneous bi-static reflections, resulting in a total of 32 wind &#x27;, &#x27;measurements per second by the full constellation.&#x27;]</dd><dt><span>comment :</span></dt><dd>[&#x27;This Level 3 gridded product combines all 8 x 4 = 32 reflectivities &#x27;, &#x27;measurements made by the CYGNSS constellation each second, uniformly &#x27;, &#x27;sampled in latitude, longitude and time.&#x27;]</dd><dt><span>program :</span></dt><dd>CYGNSS</dd><dt><span>project :</span></dt><dd>CYGNSS</dd><dt><span>references :</span></dt><dd>[&#x27;Ruf, C., D.
